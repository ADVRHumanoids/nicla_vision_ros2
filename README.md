# nicla_vision_ros2
ROS interface for the Arduino Nicla Vision board

## Note
We rely on the [audio_common_msgs](https://github.com/ros-drivers/audio_common/tree/master/audio_common_msgs) for the microphone data. Nevertheless, such package is not available as binary for ros2 yet. Hence, for now, we have copy-pasted the messages in this repo itself.
